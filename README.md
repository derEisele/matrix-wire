# matrix-wire

A Matrix Bridge for the [Wire-Messenger](https://wire.com).

The matrix part is handled by [mautrix-python](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-twitter)
and the wire protocol is implemented in [wire-nio](https://github.com/derEisele/wire-nio).

It is heavily inspired by [mautrix-twitter](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-twitter) and other *mautrix-* bridges.
Therefore, it contains code of it.
